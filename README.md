# My Personal Portfolio Website 2.0

This site is built purely with React, Sass and Javascript.

Check my previous website built with Material UI [here](https://github.com/Ziyang-98/My-website)!

## Motivation

As trivial as it sounds, I wanted challenge myself by not relying on any external libraries for the components and styling of the new website. Considering how I "abused" frontend libraries without knowing how they work, I wanted to learn basic web development through developing my own components and styling. Of course, this website is not developed is not pure Javascript, HTML and CSS and I am still using React framework that abstracts away much of web development. However, I wanted to focus on improving my styling and component building skills. Hence React is here to make things easier by handling state management, complex javascript executions and optimizations.

Throughout the project, I've learned to make complex components such as carousels, tooltips and modals. I've also learned to build layouts with CSS Grid, CSS animations and transitions, responsive web views with media querying and many other features.

At the end of the release, I come to appreciate how Javascript, HTML and CSS work together to create composite UI systems. Unironically, the process motivated me to explore more beneath all those pretty and complex React/Javascript libraries out there. This has helped to rebuild my foundation in frontend engineering and motivated me to seek for knowledge so that I can create complex and performant systems in the future.

Of course, this is not the end for this website. I plan to add more features, improve the site and make more cool stuff as I get inspirations, so stay tuned!
