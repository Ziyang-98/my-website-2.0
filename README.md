# My Personal Portfolio Website 2.0

This site is built purely with React, Sass and Javascript.

Check my previous website built with Material UI [here](https://github.com/Ziyang-98/My-website)!

## Motivation

I decided that as a challenge, I will not to use any external libraries for the components and styling of the new website. Considering how I "abused" frontend libraries without knowing how they work, it was an eye-opening development journey for me.

During the project, I've learned to make complex components such as carousels, tooltips and modals. I've also learned to build layouts with CSS Grid, CSS animations and transitions, build responsive web views with media querying and many more concepts in the vast field of web development.

As a result, I created a nice portfolio website and more importantly, gained a profound appreciation of how plain old Javascript, HTML and CSS work together to create composite UI systems. This fuels my passion to gain a better understanding of web development at its core, and with a stronger core, I will be able to create complex and performant systems.

I plan to add more features and improve the site in the future when I get more inspirations, so stay tuned!
