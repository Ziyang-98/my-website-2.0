# My Personal Portfolio Website 2.0

This site is built purely with React, Sass and Javascript.

Check my previous website built with Material UI [here](https://github.com/Ziyang-98/My-website)!

## Motivation

I decided that as a challenge, I won't rely on any external libraries for the components and styling of the new website. Considering how I "abused" frontend libraries without knowing how they work, I wanted to learn the fundamentals of web development through developing my own components and styling. While one may argue that I am still using React framework that abstracts away much of basic web development, I wanted to focus on improving my styling and component building skills. Hence React is here to help me handle state management and optimizations.

Throughout the project, I've learned to make complex components such as carousels, tooltips and modals. I've also learned to build layouts with CSS Grid, CSS animations and transitions, build responsive web views with media querying and many more concepts in the vast field of web development.

As a result, I created a nice portfolio website with cool animations that I would have used libraries to implement in the past (and I am proud of myself for not using them!). More importantly, I gained a profound appreciation of how plain old Javascript, HTML and CSS work together to create composite UI systems. Overall, this has fueled my interest to gain a better understanding of web development at its core, and with a stronger foundation, I can look forward to creating complex and performant systems in the future.

Of course, this is not the end of development for this website. I plan to add more features, improve the site and make more cool stuff as I get more inspirations, so stay tuned!
