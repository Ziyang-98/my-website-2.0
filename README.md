# My Personal Portfolio Website

This site is built purely with React, Sass and Javascript.

Here is the list of references I used for my site:

## Reflections

### First Release (10/8/24)

At the start of the project, I decided that as a challenge, I will not to use any external libraries for the components and styling of my website. Considering how I "abused" frontend libraries without knowing how they work, it was an eye-opening and fulfilling development journey for me.

During the project, I've learned to make complex components such as carousels, tooltips and modals. I've also learned more about building layouts with CSS Grid, CSS animations and transitions, building responsive web views with media querying and many more in the vast field of web development.

At the end of it, I became a slightly better web developer and more importantly, learn to appreciate plain old Javascript, HTML and CSS much more than before.

I plan to add more features and improve the site in the future when I got more inspirations, so stay tuned!
